    "The **factorial** function should take a single positive integer `n` and return the product of all positive integers from 1 up to `n`. This is a basic mathematical operation used extensively in probability and combinatorics.\n",

    "Next, implement a **combinations** function to calculate how many ways `k` items can be selected from a group of `n` items, regardless of order. This is commonly referred to as \"n choose k\" and is calculated using the factorial formula:\n",
